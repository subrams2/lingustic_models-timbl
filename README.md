# lingustic_models-timble
We present classiﬁcation methods with diverse a feature set for the task of classifying stance of tweets on pre-speciﬁed targets (Atheism, Hillary Clinton, Feminist movement, Climate change, Trump).

1. We compare several predictive models including Naive Bayes and Scikit-learn's Random forest with varying feature sets.

2. A reasonable argument is made about the working and the results of each tested model.

3. All the models are run using the Tilburg Memory-Based Learner or TiMBL, an open-source package including several memory-based and supervised algorithms. We also add the Subjectivity and Arguing lexicons for modeling.

4. The random forest approach performed the best in predicting the stance of Atheism in tweets.
